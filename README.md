# CodeWars-Exxx
CodeWars exercises for moi using any programming language

## Why this?
I'll compute some exercises taken from [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard). I'll just make an src folder and in every
.cpp, .c, .js, .py or any other file, I'll type in the exercises. 

## Why this x2?
I'm motivated, I've been having kinda bad days but let's try it

## Clone it?
Sure

```bash
$ git clone https://www.github.com/Its-Yayo/CodeWars-Exxx.git
$ cd CodeWars-Exxx
```

## Update it in ur localhost?
Sure
```bash
$ git pull origin
```
