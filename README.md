# CodeWars-Exxx
CodeWars exercises for moi using any programming language

## Why this?
I'll compute some exercises taken from [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard). I'll just make an src folder and in every
.cpp, .c, .js, .py, .rs or any other programming file, I'll type in the exercises. 

Exercises will be categorized as Easy (8 kyu to 5 kyu), Medium (4 kyu to 2 kyu) and Hard (1 dan...)

## Why this x2?
It's like a therapy for me for my purpuse/eternity path :))

## Clone it?
Sure
```bash
$ git clone https://www.github.com/Its-Yayo/CodeWars-Exxx.git
$ cd CodeWars-Exxx
```

## Update it in ur localhost?
Sure
```bash
$ git pull origin
```
